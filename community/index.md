#Community

## Teams
Teams will be formed leading up to and at the September Kickoff meetings. Team information will be posted here. Organizations that have registered to participate in the Challenge may or may not be committed (yet) to a team. Some organizations might participate in more than one team. Many teams will come together at the Kickoff meeting. Some teams will be formed after the Kickoff as other organizations hear about the Challenge or some team and want to join. 

## Projects
The teams may be focused on some specific modeling and simulation problem. Alternatively, multiple teams may contribute to some project that serves all teams. Some projects under development include:
* Interoperable Co-simulation platform to serve TE
* Open-source TE protolocs (developing code-base for Energy Interoperation transactive services)
* Detailed modeling scenarios for TE
