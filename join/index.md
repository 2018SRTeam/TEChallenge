#Join the TE Challenge

You may sign up as your organization alone, or a team (if you already know who you plan to work with), or part of a team (if you have a partner and an idea, but still need some other team members to make the project work).

The basics are simply telling us who you are (organization and individual contact info) and then what your idea is (or your capabilities that you hope to bring to the table to potentially join a team). There is other information that will be useful to the TE Community, of course, about what each team will be doing. But, to get started, please click on the link below to send us an email so we can get in contact.
