#Join the TE Challenge--Registration

You may register your organization alone, or a team (if you already know who you plan to work with), or part of a team (if you have a partner and an idea, but still need some other team members to make the project work).

Note: registering to participate in the Challenge doesn't mean that we assume everyone will come to the Sept. 10 Kickoff event or any later meeting. [Please go here to let us know who is attending the Kickoff meeting](https://www-s.nist.gov/CRS/conf_disclosure.cfm?&conf_id=8534).

#Needed Information

The basics are simply telling us who you are (organization and individual contact info) and then what your idea is (or your capabilities that you hope to bring to the table to potentially join a team). Beyond that, if you already have team members, then share who they are and what roles each of you will play, milestones and objectives, etc. Whatever details you have now is great!

Share what you can in writing, but if you would rather talk on the phone, then send the basics in the email (at the button below) and then give us a call. Thank you!

P.S. some have asked about IPR concerns. The policy is, "All information and results provided as part of the Challenge will be in the public domain. This does not preclude the use of proprietary techniques or tools to achieve the results."
