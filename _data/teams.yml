- name: Project Reference Grid and Scenarios for TE Simulation
  type: academia mainly
  lead: TBD
  email: 
  phone: 
  capabilities: modeling and simulation experts
  url: http://www.nist.gov/smartgrid/techallenge.cfm
  ideas: develop a reference grid design and interoperability requirements to in turn allow testing of different TE approaches using different simulationtools while producing comparable results for a set of agreed on scenarios.
  partners: CMU, PNNL, Vanderbilt
  plans: (1) Project setup (a) develop/agree on a baseline distribution grid topology, (b) develop/agree on baseline scenario and (c) develop/agree on report formats and metrics to evaluate results. (2) Add some transactive approach and run the baseline scenario to demonstrate a working model. (3) Develop set of scenarios which add complexity and exercise the model over a range of grid challenges. (4) Document the project and results. 
  approach: No TE Approach, rather developing the foundational components. 
  scenario: Scenarios will be developed as part of the team effort
  validation: validation and metrics will be agreed on as part of the project
  timeline: Goal is to move this forward step by step as resources allow over the next year, using TE Challenge meetings as opportunities to meet, as well as virtual team meetings. 
  data: We will need to find and agree on some reference data sources--both a reference distribution grid as well as input data. 
  participants: at least one representative from each partner organization
  other: This project provides a (1) a reference grid design for different research teams to use different tools to model the same scenarios and get comparable results, and (2) a set of scenarios that can be used to exercise different kinds of grid challenges for which TE approaches can be tested. In addition, this project works together with the Interoperable Co-imulation Platform project. 
- name: Project Interoperable Co-simulation Platform
  type: academia mainly
  lead: Vanderbilt
  email: email of leader
  phone: phone of leader
  capabilities: co-simulation platform development
  url: team web site
  ideas: Need an “Open Platform” for integrating and coordinating across a diverse suite of modeling and simulation tools, and onduct integrated experiments
  partners: VU, PNNL
  plans: Develop C2WT, in conjunction with PNNL team to agree on common co-simulation platform for TE. 
  approach: TBD
  scenario: This project is about the foundational co-simulation platform, not any specific TE approach or scenario
  validation: TBD
  timeline: TBD
  data: data formats will be standardized for inputs and outputs
  participants: at least one individual from each partner organization
  other:
