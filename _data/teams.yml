# team5
- name: Co-Simulation Platforms
  type: 
  lead: TBD
  url: "./team5"
  ideas:
  - title: Create a system of systems; co-simulation of different nodes/planets revolving around central ‘sun’ as shown in Figure 1
  - title: Could have multiple simulation platforms (not just a single central one)
