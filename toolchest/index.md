#TE Challenge Tool Chest

##Modeling and Simulation Tools

Modeling and simulation tools and platforms for grid simulations were identified at our TE Challenge Preparatory Workshop.  Some of these tools may be useful for transactive grid simulations (and co-simulations). The table of tools in our Tool Chest is based on input from our workshop attendees. The table provides a short description of each tool based on the owners own claims from the tool website. Those who think a tool might be useful can follow the link to get more information. TE Challenge participants may provide links to other tools and additional information to add to this table.

##Data sets

If you know of publicly available data sets, please send us a link so we can add to the Tool Chest.

##Baseline Scenarios

In order to have results that are more comparable between teams, allowing results to be more easily integrated, with common resources, objectives and metrics, a  set of baseline scenarios is being prepared in a collaborative process.

##FAQ

**Q. How do organizations participate--where's the funding?**

A. Many groups are attaching their participation to existing projects, teaming up with other organizations to gain the benefits of collaboration with shared goals. Other teams find funding from one team member or another. We hope that as the Challenge proceeds that some other funding sources will become available.

**Q. What kind of reporting is required?**

A. Our primary goal is to give a platform for teams to form and do exciting work and then share that with others. We do hope that teams will supply information that helps us (TE community) understand:
    What modeling and simulation tools were used for what purposes.
    What tool extensions were made or new co-simulations performed.
    What TE approaches were investigated and what results were found.
    What data resources were used, tools developed, exciting results found, collaborations formed, lessons learned, and other resources that might be used to build up the TE community. 

**Q. What are the IPR-sharing requirements?**

A. Only share what you want to make public. Of course, the more that a team shares, the more everyone else can learn and the greater the benefit to moving TE forward as a whole. 
It is our goal to have an ongoing dialog and up to date information to serve Challenge participants and strengthen the Challenge process as it advances. The collaboration site will host a FAQ, TE Challenge announcements and updates, links to relevant outside TE publications, etc.

**Q. What is the long-term goal for the Challenge?**

A. NIST has been working on Smart Grid standards interoperability for 6+ years. TE is about responsive demand for the next generation grid. We see the development of TE as slow process and this TE Challenge as Phase I of perhaps a multi-phase effort. Phase II would be more focused on specific projects that are identified as part of Phase I. Maybe 2+ years from now we will see what TE approaches work and will have utilities piloting these approaches.
