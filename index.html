      <h2 class="section-title">What is the TE Challenge?</h2>
	<p>Transactive Energy (TE) refers to techniques for managing the generation, consumption, or flow of electric power within the electric power system through the use of economic or market-based constructs while considering grid reliability constraints. As the electric grid transforms to integrate more wind and solar energy and to give customers more choice and control in their use of energy, the concept of transactive energy is likely to play a key role. Members of NIST’s Smart Grid Team have been working closely with the Department of Energy to understand TE’s potential and to support utilities, technology developers and policy makers. The TE Challenge will bring researchers and companies with simulation tools together with utilities, product developers, and other grid stakeholders to create and demonstrate modeling and simulation platforms while applying transactive energy approaches to real grid problems.</p>
